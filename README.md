# hi
I'm Michael, a nerd / geek / whatever you want to call me \
I like everything about computers and practical mathematics and engineering in general \
To me the coolest part about computers is the hardware and how it is designed, and how we can efficiently use it to its fullest \
My current most "complete" solo project is my Bingo Simulator, which multithreads efficiently generating a nearly infinite amount of bingo cards and tests how many moves they take to finish \
I also have some other repos, such as LocalPro Connect, a website built from scratch with some peers for the University of Florida \
There are plans to expand this later but I'm not an English Major now am I
